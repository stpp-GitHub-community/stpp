# stpp: Space-Time Point Pattern Simulation, Visualisation and Analysis

Many of the models encountered in applications of point process methods to the study of spatio-temporal phenomena are covered in 'stpp'. This package provides statistical tools for analyzing the second-order properties of spatio-temporal point processes, including estimators of the space-time inhomogeneous K-function and pair correlation function. It also includes tools to get static and dynamic display of spatio-temporal point patterns. See Gabriel et al. (2013).

## This is the development version

**Installation guide**

The easiest way to install the development version of `stpp` from GitHub is using the `remotes` package which can be installed run the next command:
```
install.packages('remotes')
```
and thereafter run the commands:
```
require(remotes)
install_github('stpp-GitHub-community/stpp')
```
